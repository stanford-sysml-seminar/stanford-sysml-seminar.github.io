      title: "A Taxonomy of Machine Learning for Systems Problems"
      abstract: "Machine learning has the potential to significantly improve computer systems. While recent research in this area has shown great promise, not all problems are equally well-suited for applying ML techniques, and some remaining challenges have prevented wider adoption of ML in systems. In this talk, I will introduce a taxonomy to classify machine learning for systems approaches, discuss how to identify cases that are a good fit for machine learning, and lay out a longer-term vision of how different systems can be improved using ML techniques, ranging from computer architecture to language runtimes."
      bio: "Martin Maas is a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind.

      title: "Democratizing Foundation Models via k-bit Quantization"
      abstract: "Foundation models are effective tools for many tasks but are challenging to finetune and inference due to their GPU memory requirements. Compressing foundation models with k-bit quantization makes them more accessible with minimal resources, but k-bit quantization can lead to degradation in model quality. In this lecture, I will talk about fundamental insights into how to compress foundation models with quantization while maintaining their predictive performance. We will learn about emergent outliers in large language models (LLMs) and how they affect performance during 8-bit quantization. We will learn how to do effective k-bit compression of pretrained large language models such that we maximize their density of predictive performance per bit. We will also talk about how to do efficient fine-tuning of quantized 4-bit LLMs (QLoRA) and how this helps to build state-of-the-art chatbots."
      bio: "Tim Dettmers is a graduating PhD student advised by Luke Zettlemoyer at the University of Washington in Seattle. He holds degrees in applied math and computer science and has a background in industrial automation. His primary research goal is to democratize foundation models by making them more efficient and accessible through quantization, sparsification, and building machine learning systems that use consumer-grade hardware. He is the creator of the bitsandbytes library. Tim runs a blog about deep learning, GPUs, and PhD life at timdettmers.com."

      title: "Training Large Language Models at Scale"
      abstract: "Training LLMs efficiently is challenging for a few reasons: training can require yottaFLOPs of compute,  and accelerators have limited memory capacity making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naïve usage of these methods leads to scaling issues at thousands of GPUs. In this talk, I describe various systems innovations incorporated into Megatron-LM (https://github.com/nvidia/megatron-lm) that allow us to run training iterations for models with up to a trillion parameters on thousands of GPUs."
      bio: "Deepak is a Senior Applied Deep Learning Research Scientist in the ADLR group at NVIDIA, where he builds software systems to more efficiently train and serve LLMs. He graduated from Stanford with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in September 2021, where he was advised by Prof. Matei Zaharia."

      title: "Serving 100s of Fine-Tuned LLMs on 1 GPU with LoRAX"
      abstract: "Smaller, specialized language models such as LLaMA-2-7b can outperform larger general-purpose models like GPT-4 when fine-tuned on proprietary data to perform a single task. But serving many fine-tuned LLMs in production can quickly add up to tens of thousands of dollars per month in cloud costs when each model requires its own dedicated GPU resources. LoRA Exchange (LoRAX) is an LLM inference system built for serving numerous fine-tuned LLMs using a shared set of GPU resources. With LoRAX, users can pack over 100 task-specific models into a single GPU, significantly reducing the expenses associated with serving fine-tuned models by orders of magnitude over dedicated deployments. In this seminar, we'll explore the challenges of serving fine-tuned LLMs in production, and the motivation behind building a system like LoRAX. We'll introduce parameter efficient fine-tuning adapters like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and show how LoRAX dynamically loads and exchanges different adapters at runtime, leveraging a tiered weight cache to speed up this exchange process. Additionally, we'll show how LoRAX achieves high throughput with continuous multi-adapter batching, allowing requests from different fine-tuned adapters to batch together within a single decoding step."

      title: Bringing Foundational Models to Consumer Devices via ML Compilation
      abstract: "Deploying deep learning models on various devices has become an important topic. Machine learning compilation is an emerging field that leverages compiler and automatic search techniques to accelerate AI models. ML compilation brings a unique set of challenges: emerging machine learning models; increasing hardware specialization brings a diverse set of acceleration primitives; growing tension between flexibility and performance.  In this talk. I then discuss our experience in bringing foundational models to a variety of devices and hardware environments through machine learning compilation."

      title: "Monarch Mixer: Making Foundation Models More Efficient"
      abstract: "Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures like Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. In this talk I'll discuss Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension. M2 mixes information along the sequence and model dimensions using Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically."
